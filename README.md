QTLNetMiner
===========

QTLNetMiner is a client-server application for biological knowledge mining and discovery. It supports advanced queries, query suggestions and interactive visualisations. Most client code is written in JavaScript/HTML5 using and extending libraries such as Cytoscape.js and D3.js to visualise genomics and network data. The server is written purely in Java making use of the Ondex API (www.ondex.org) to query a large genome-scale knowledge network (graph database). The graph database is indexed using Lucene and hold in memory to allow fast graph queries.
